Open Vancouver empowers Vancouverites to shape the future of their own neighbourhoods by allowing them to collectively add suggestions, pictures and comments to an online interactive map.
The map is configured for visitors to "vote up" existing suggestions or add their own.
Further the users are encouraged to continue the conversation on social media sites like Facebook.
The suggestions might range from supplying a bench at a tagged location, fixing a water fountain, building a washroom, creating a green-space, or planting a boulivard garden.

This project is deeply indebted to a lot of other amazing open source projects found at Open Plans and civic-minded artists like Candy Chang.

Open Vancouverâ€™s map is intended to contribute to actual city planning process that are ongoing into 2013 in in Grandview-Woodland, Marpole and the West-End.
